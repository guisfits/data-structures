## Notes

- Stacks if LIFO (Last in, first our) behavior
- Useful
    - To undo and redo things
    - Build compilers to (eg syntax checking)
    - Evaluate expressions (eg 1 + 2 * 3)
    - Build navigation (eg forward/back)
- We can implement using array or LinkedLists 
- All operations run in `o(1)`
