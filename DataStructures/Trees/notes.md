# Notes

- A tree is a data-structure that stores elements in a hierarchy
- In a `Binary Tree`, a node can have two children
- Some common usage
  - Represent hierarchical data
  - Indexes of database
  - Autocompletion
  - Compilers
  - Compression (JPEG, MP3)
- The first node is called `root`
- A bottom node without any children if called `leaf`
- The height of a `leaf` node `0`. As we go up in the tree the height increase
- The height is equal to the height of the root node.
- In the root node, the `depth` is `0`.
- The `deepest` of a Tree is max number of the edge to a leaf node
- A `Binary Search Tree` is special type of tress that the values on the left is smaller and the right is greater than the value of the node itself
- There some algorithms to traversing binary trees
  - **Breadth First**
    - **Level-Order**: Left to Right level by level
  - **Depth First**
    - **Pre-order**: _Root_, Left, Right
    - **In-Order**: Left, _Root_, Right
    - **Post-Order**: Lef, Right, _Root_
- Lookup run in `o(log n)`, that means if you want find an item in a huge amount of data, `Binary Search Tree` will perform more than a Linear DataStructure - like Arrays or LinkedList.
